If any how, some day if u see this.
I just want to tell a clear msg "I love you ðŸ’—".

I know we will never meet.
I know if we can't even meet.
we can't even be life partners.

Wished from god only u,
first as life partner 
but it didn't work out ðŸ˜” 

then wished, u be my best friend 
thinking that god can't give u as life partner so why not 'best friend.

again it didn't work out 

thought only praying god won't work
so tried myself, If I could reach u
tell u, what I feel for u.

really it didn't work out ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜ž 

atleast U replied ðŸ˜” 

but only single time
might be a mistaken reply from u
I thought (may be right?) 

asked u to abuse me
guess what, it didn't work out ðŸ˜­ 

then thought 
all good 
u blocked
u ignored 
u didn't talk on call
u didn't reply on Truecaller 
u didn't reply on sms
all good

think what
started Searching u on social media

again I failed

that is some point 
I think
u are like me...
may be I am wrong!
I didn't exist on any social media

instagram facebook 
twitter snapchat 

I didn't like them use
but created accounts on them
just for u, in case I could find u

not so that can harras u 
as u blocked me
instead just finding 
only if I could see u
if you are find good ok better
living life with happiness 

then what happened 
no I couldn't find you

now starting hating myself
don't worry (if u really care)
I hurt myself
but even I can't keep happy myself

a hope again took place 
thought let's find some school friends 
u may be in contact with...

noooo....
I couldn't find anyone knowing u.

but wait I found someone 
Jyoti Mishra (Khushi)
on Instagram 
thought let's msg her 
and ask about u

but my bad luck
It's been long time Jyoti is not active instagram...

ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž

Still remember the day
When I last saw u
it was 2019
school farewell

I thought "as it's last day in school 

why not let u know how much I love
see let be clear
I love you ðŸ’– 
not because I am attracted to s** or just roma***.
**ðŸ’• it is pure love ðŸ’•**
I can't prove, it's a feel only u understand only then it will be proved.

Tried telling u 3 words on farewell in school
hm... Hell I am dumb
couldn't get guts
just was watching, going away from me
on that day and was just starring
as u would come to me yourself 
and that ain't gonna happen.


finally starting hate to god.
started thinking if he doesn't want me to be your friend 
why did he made me meet u.

I remember It was 6th class
when I first saw u
and that wasn't the time I fallen in love with u...

instead after a year in 7th class mid sessions
something happened I fallen in love for u.

I don't know why
when I didn't show my love to u
never talked u too much
only formal talks to u
instead don't knoe why u started 
ignoring me in higher secondary classes (11th and 12th).

may be,
not may be 
surely 
U hat# Anushka R. (Noney)
